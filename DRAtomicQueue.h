// DRAtomicQueue is ARC-compatible and retains its objects. Queues are always
//	mutable. DRAtomicQueue requires OS X 10.7 or later, or iOS 5 or later. No
//	guarantees are made about speed.

// Copying a queue is atomic with respect to the state of the queue at the time
//	of the call to -copy (i.e., a snapshot of the queue state is taken). Copying
//	is a slow operation and may block other threads using the queue.

// Serializing a queue is atomic with respect to the state of the queue at the
//	time of the call to -encodeWithCoder (i.e., a snapshot of the queue state is
//	taken). Serialization invokes -copy and comes with all the caveats thereto.
//	For a queue to be successfully serialized, all objects in the queue must
//	also be serializable. The queue supports only keyed coders and will throw an
//	exception if given a non-keyed coder.
